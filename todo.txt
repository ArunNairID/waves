SHORT TERM

do all kinds of renaming for the classes and functions and such
make the 85 you subtract out a variable of its own
redraw the car itself to be correct rather than transforming it

put invisible arcs over the cars
create a ghz line chart like in wolfram alpha
make the color change when you click on an element
can you substitute a single letter for "this"?
make a function that draws the cars and move it to the bottom to make the code cleaner
create a reset button

ARCS
have every car calculate its own start and end


LONG TERM
try the ghz formula
you can do the arc calculation easier by doing a sort of gap before and gap after and then adding them
