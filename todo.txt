create excel spreadsheet as per blog
show students how to make their own excel spreadsheets
make the cars slow down when you mouse over the road




use the v + 1/2a^2 formula



implement bootstrap
bring in open sans font

try to implement the scheme in the spreadsheet but with the caveat that the cars can only accelerate up to a certain rate and with max and minimum velocities. the main difference between my model and the spreadsheets now is that the spreadsheet's has reaction time for everything and has deeleration depend on the size of the distance between the cars.
