      <p>Have you ever been on a freeway, and suddenly traffic comes to a stop for no visible reason? Or have you ever been stuck in bumper-to-bumper congestion, and suddenly traffic clears up? If so, then you've experienced a <strong>traffic wave</strong>.</p>

      <p>A traffic wave is a block of slow-moving vehicles on a freeway that travels backwards over time. If a road is crowded with vehicles, then just one vehicle slowing down a little bit can set off a traffic wave. </p>

      <p>Click "Hit the Brakes" to slow down the highlighted car, and wait until the traffic wave forms. Mouse over a car to slow down time and see its velocty and acceleration. Clicking on a car makes it the one that brakes when you press the button.</p>

      <button id="pause" class="btn btn-lg">Pause.</button>
      <button id="reset" class="btn btn-lg btn-danger">Reset.</button>
    </div>
    <div class="clearfix"></div>

      <div id="main" ></div>

    <div id="chartExplanation">
        <h3>What causes traffic waves?</h3>
        <p>They happen because of two facts about driving: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Cars take longer to speed up than to slow down, so if you brake suddenly then it will take you a while to reach your original speed.</li>
          <li>People have <em>reaction times</em>...if the car in front of you slows down all of a sudden, you don't slow down until a couple seconds later. And the more time you lose reacting, the harder you have to brake to keep a safe distance.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Therefore, on a crowded road, if one car brakes, then the car behind it has to brake harder, and the car behind that one has to brake even harder, and so on.</p>
        <p> You can see this kind of domino effect in the chart below. Each line shows the history of the speed of a different car. At the 10-second mark, the grey car slows down, and the cars that brake later have to slow down to lower and lower minimum speeds.</p>
